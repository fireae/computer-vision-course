## 1. Get started with CImg

Learning to use CImg libray to processing image.

## 2. Canny Algorithm 

Canny is an algorithm for extracting edge from an image.

## 3. Line&Circle Detector

Make use of hough transform to detect lines or circles in an image.

|   Line detection result    |    Circle detection result     |
| :------------------------: | :----------------------------: |

## 4. A4 Warping

According to the line detector from 3 above, I make this to warping the A4 from image for A4 correction.

| :----: | :----------------------------: |
| warped | ![output1](assets/output1.BMP) |



## 5. Face-Morphing

I make use of the dlib face pose recognition library to mark the human face pose, then match two images' face pose to make warping.

## 6. Stitching

I use opencv feature extractor to extract sift feature from image, and implement RANSAC algorithm to match the feature point. Finally, I stitching image together.

## 7. Threshold Segmentation

Make a comparision of Global Threshold Segmentation and Ostu Segmentation.

## 8. A4 Handwriting Number Recognizer

I train opencv svm classifier on MNIST and implement it on the A4 handwriting number recognition.
